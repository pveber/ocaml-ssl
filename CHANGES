0.4.6 (2011-10-16)
=====
* Added write_certificate function.
* Remove support for SSLv2, which was dropped upstream (thanks Dario Teixeira).
* Added support for compiling under Win32 (thanks David Allsopp), see
  README.win32.
* Check for pthreads in configure.

0.4.5 (2011-03-01)
=====
* Use pthread mutexes for locking thread-safe version of ssl.

0.4.4 (2010-01-06)
=====
* Use SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file instead of
  SSL_CTX_use_certificate_file.
* Added support for --enable-debugging configure option.
* Don't link with unix library and don't build in custom mode.

0.4.3 (2008-12-18)
=====
* Don't use blocking sections in finalizers since it causes segfaults (thanks
  Grégoire Henry and Stéphane Glondu).

0.4.2 (2007-03-29)
=====
* Added some missing blocking sections (reported by Oscar Hellström).

0.4.1 (2007-02-21)
=====
* file_descr_of_socket is not marked as deprecated anymore.
* Patched the Makefile to be compatible with FreeBSD (thanks Jaap Boender).
* Explicitely link with libcrypto since we use it. Compilation should now work
  on Mac OS X too (thanks Janne Hellsten).

0.4.0 (2006-09-09)
=====
* Using caml_alloc_custom and Data_custom_val to access custom blocks.
* Added set_password_callback function.
* Integrated a big patch from Chris Waterson:
- Added get_error_string function.
- Read and write are not blocking anymore, use Unix.select and
  file_descr_of_socket if you want blocking functions.
- Fix SSL_CTX initialization to call SSL_CTX_set_mode(3) with
  SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY flag. This causes SSL_read and SSL_write to "hide" the
  SSL_ERROR_WANT_(READ|WRITE) errors that may occur during renegotiation on a
  blocking socket.
- Fix SSL_CTX initialization to call SSL_CTX_set_mode(3) with
  SSL_MODE_ACCEPT_MOVING_WRITE_BUFFER flag. This allows for a different buffer
  address to be passed to a restarted non-blocking write operation, which is
  useful since the OCaml garbage collector may move buffers around between
  calls.
- We do not need to store explicitely the file descriptor for SSL sockets.
* Corrected checking of errors in ocaml_ssl_read (thanks Vincent Balat and
  Nataliya Guts).
* input_char now raises End_of_file when no byte could be read (thanks Nataliya
  Guts).

0.3.1 (2005-07-21)
=====
* The library is now under the LGPL licence + linking exception + linking with
  openssl exception (see COPYING for more details).

0.3.0 (2005-06-01)
=====
* Added Ssl_threads.init function to make the library thread-safe.
* Put connect, accept and flush (and all other functions) in blocking_section to
  allow other threads to run in the meantime.
* Unified the three context creation functions in create_context, the
  certificate to use should now be sepcified with use_certificate (sorry for the
  API-breakage).
* Added the get_verify_result function.
* Using Store_field instead of Field(...) = ...
* Using caml namespace functions.

0.2.0 (2004-12-18)
=====
* Many thanks to Thomas Fischbacher for his patches:
- Corrected int / val bugs when raising exceptions from C (those where found by
  Mike Furr too, thanks).
- Added many fonctions (but in Caml instead of C).
* Context creation functions now take the protocol as argument.
* Added the create_context function (for client and server connections).
* Added functions for verifying certificates: client_verify_callback,
  set_verify, set_verify_depth, verify.
* The cipher now has its own type.
* Added functions to handle ciphers: get_current_cipher, get_cipher_description,
  get_cipher_name, get_cipher_version, set_cipher_list.
* Added the read_certificate and load_verify_locations functions.
* Added the open_connection_with_context and flush functions.
* read and write functions are now thread-safe.
* Cleaned the stubs (function prototypes, comments, etc.).
* Updated OCamlMakefile and improved build system.

0.1.0 (2004-02-05)
=====
* Initial release.

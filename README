Dependencies
============
To build this library you need to have OCaml 3.08 and the openssl library.


Installation
============
To compile the program type:

./configure
make

(you can set specific build options with the configure script, see
./configure --help) then, to install it, type as root:

make install


Is this library thread-safe?
============================
Yes it is if and only if the first function you call in ocaml-ssl is Ssl_threads.init (and the second one should be Ssl.init).


Creating a self-signed ssl certificate
======================================
To get started quickly you can create a self-signed ssl certificate using
openssl.

1. First, create a 1024-bit private key to use when creating your CA.:

openssl genrsa -des3 -out privkey.pem 1024

2. Create a master certificate based on this key, to use when signing other
   certificates:

openssl req -new -x509 -days 1001 -key privkey.pem -out cert.pem


SSL acknowledgment
==================
This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in the
OpenSSL Toolkit. (http://www.openssl.org/)
